When explaining code, always include:

1. **Draw a diagram**: Use ASCII art to show the flow, structure, or relationships
2. **Walk through the code**: Explain step-by-step what happens
3. **Highlight a gotcha**: What's a common mistake or misconception?
4. **Alternatives**: What's a common alternatives for this, what are the best practices?x

Keep explanations conversational. For complex concepts, use multiple alternatives.
